I’m a student from Maths background who’s deeply curious about how complex systems actually work.  
I love exploring new technologies, understanding their core logic, and then implementing them in my own way.  

Still in the learning phase, but I’m not in a rush — because for me, mastering something means understanding it inside out.  
Every day, I try to push myself a bit further
