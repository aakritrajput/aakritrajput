## Backend | Full-Stack | AI/ML

I’m a student from Maths background who’s deeply curious about how complex systems actually work.  
I love exploring new technologies, understanding their core logic, and then implementing them in my own way.  

Currently, I’m diving into **AI/ML**, absolutely amazed by how intelligence can be created through data and algorithms.  
I’ve already built multiple **full-stack projects** (personal and professional), especially focusing on backend and scalable architectures.

Still in the learning phase, but I’m not in a rush — because for me, mastering something means understanding it inside out.  
Every day, I try to push myself a bit further
